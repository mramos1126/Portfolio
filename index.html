<img id="me" src="../assets/images/mauricio.jpg">
<p> Hi I'm Mauricio Ramos. I  work for a property management company called Kamson Corporation and I am currently enrolled to Rutgers for web developing. When it comes to interest, I use to customize jackets, took up boxing classes over the summer, read comics and practice the guitar even though I also play videogames once in a while with action-platform and rpg being my favorite genres. </p>
<p> I also spend my time going to shows in New York. I have been doing this high school. I usually go to small venues since you get a better experience. Traveling has been a interest I have been taken up lately. I am planning of going to London very soon! </p>
